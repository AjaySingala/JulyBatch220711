Cloud Computing:
================
Separate storage and computing. Partially.
Over the cloud (internet). Partially.

Series of comps put together over a network. No.
Should be able to share and exchange data - there are multiple servers ---- No.

A VM:
A machine on another machine. It is not a physical box.

Characteristics and benefits of Cloud Computing:
- Shared resources.
- You can provision VMs in minutes.
- Pay as you go (pay for what you use)
	- Reduces your cost.
	- reducing your CapEx (Capital Expenditure)
	- Instead of CapEx, you have OpEx (Operational Expenditure)
	- don't pay for rent, electricty, salary of network engineer etc.
- Scalability
	- Flexible / configurable.
	- Whenever the utilization of servers goes > 80% for more than 5 minutes, add 2 more VMs.
	- Whenever the utilization of servers goes < 40% for more than 5 minutes, remove 2 more VMs.
	- At any given time, there must be at least 3 VMs running.
- Accessibility
	- From anywhere as long as you have internet connectivity.
- Automatic updates
- Business continuity
- Secure

Types of clouds:
- on-premise (not cloud):
	- everything is owned and hosted by the organization.
- Public
	- Physical servers, storage, networking etc. owned and procured by the cloud service provider (CSP).
	- No setup & maintenance worries.
	- Most common type of cloud.
	- anyone can use - individuals, enterprises.
	- AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- Private
	- located on-premise (at client's premises) or hosted by CSP.
	- private servers available to specific organization users.
	- resources are used by the origanzation only and not by public.
	- government agencies, financial insttitions etc.
	- cost a bit more than public cloud.
- Hybrid
	- on-premise/private and public cloud.
	- For e.g.; web app is on public cloud and DB server is on-premise/private cloud.

Types of services on cloud (3 core cloud services):
IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service.
PaaS: Platform as a Service.
SaaS: Software as a Service.

DBaaS: DataBase as a Service
MLaaS: Machine Learning
CaaS:   Containers
IDaaS:	Identity (security, user and roles and group management, authentication & authorization).
	- Authentication: Credentials (are you a valid user).
	- Authorization: What can you do once authenticated.
STaaS: Storage

AWS - Amazon Web Service
EC2 - Elastic Cloud Compute (IaaS)
S3	- Simple Storage Service
RDS - Relational Database Service

Amazon Linux VM: ec2-user@<public-dns>
Ubuntu: ubuntu@<public-dns>


S3: storage of files. Not a DB.
You have to first create a "bucket".
In the bucket, you can create folders and sub-folders.
Store files in these folders / subfolders.
Free only upto a limit.
Post free limit, there is a charge per GB.

EC2 instances:
On-Demand: You ask for it and you get it.
Spot instances: AWS has 10s of thousands of servers. Not all are utilized at all times.
	Ununtilized instances, they offer at heavy discounts, sometimes at 90% off.
	It's like an auction. If you "bid" for a spot instance, you have to provide a price. 
	Let's say you get that instance.
	Later, if someone else bids a higher price for it, you will lose that instance and it goes to the other person.
	You will get a notification about it. If you want you can give a higher price.

	AWS EMR Cluster:
	Master node: 1
	Task/Data nodes: 1000 Spot Instances
		even if you lose 20 of them, it's ok.

Reserved Instances:
	They are reserved for you at a fixed price.
