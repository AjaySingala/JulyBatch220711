Audit: Audit refers to maintaining a log of all the operations related to the ETL flow (the start/end date and time, number of rows processed, inserted, updated, and rejected/deleted in each step. One can take this to a deeper level and record the column-level audit report such as how many values are updated per column, etc.

Balance: We need to be able to explain the difference between the source(s) and target(s) in each step of the process, whether it’s a Data Integration, Data Migration, or any other process that copies/moves the data from a source to a target. It’s about ensuring data quality and integrity. This process primarily helps with data reconciliation.

Control: Control activity refers to the design aspect of restartability, exception handling, scheduling, and automation in general.
